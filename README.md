# Doppelganger: Actor face-recognition (chrome-extension)

This is the code we used to create the [DoppelGanger Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doppelganger-by-visageclo/gbpgnjkglihhdjjedjkbnhegkflgglnk)
which lets you right-click on any picture in your browser and face-search for the most similar actors to the people depicted, using the [VisageCloud](http://visagecloud.com) face recognition & search API.

We thought this would be a fun exercise for those who wants to have point-and-click demo of [VisageCloud](http://visagecloud.com) over several images.
